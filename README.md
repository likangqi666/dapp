# Please download and use 'develop' branch.
# 'master' branch now is a backup of the previous code I implemented before.
I keep this branch here because the ownership belongs to the company where I did my internship. It is a very very small possibility but they probably may ask me something about this code. So I leave it here as well.


These projects are created by ReactJX.
The simplest implementation procedure for react is described here:
https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html

The only dependency is the web3 as the API for Ethereum smart contracts.
To start one node server, just open that folder path and use:
	npm start
	
The notes for the source code are usually added in the user folder.

The source code for the smart contract is "contract.sol"

The editor and compilor for ".sol" files is:
https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/

One simple tutorial for using webpage injected web3 component to deploy smart contract is:

The method will be the same if you want to use Mist instead of Metamask.
