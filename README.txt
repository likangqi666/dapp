These projects are created by ReactJX.
The simplest implementation procedure for react is described here:

The only dependency is the web3 as the API for Ethereum smart contracts.
To start one node server, just open that folder path and use:
	npm start
	
The notes for the source code are usually added in the user folder.

The source code for the smart contract is "contract.sol"

The editor and compilor for ".sol" files is:

One simple tutorial for using webpage injected web3 component to deploy smart contract is:
